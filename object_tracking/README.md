### Object-tracking
Assignment:
<br/>
A person comes in the view, cloaks himself except the object in hand, the object thus looks floating in the air. 
The object's track leaves a trail, thus the person uses that trail to write word "awiros" in the camera view. 
So basically, it would look like a floating object writing the word "awiros" with it's trail.


Problem Statement: You have to create a video of yourself as an output where once you wear a cloak over yourself all the portions covered by the cloak 
and the cloak itself become invisible in short you become invisible. 
Your any one hand(which is out of the cloak and hence visible) should contain any object you like which has to be detected and tracked. 
And the trail lines of the tracked object should be drawn over the video 
and by your hand movement you have to form the word "Awiros" in air 
but as you are drawing the track trails it should get written over the output video.

- Deliverables:
     1. An output video performing the above problem. 
     2. All the code required to get the result given by you in the output video
     3. Dockerfile (Optional)
